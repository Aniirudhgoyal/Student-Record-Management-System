COL100 Assignment 6 - Student Record Management System

Overview:
This project implements a Student Record Management System using a Doubly Linked List in C. The system allows for managing student records, including operations such as creating records,
deleting records, removing duplicates, rotating the list, reversing the list, and sorting records by GPA.

Features:
1. Creating Student Records
Dynamically creates student records and stores them in a doubly linked list. Each student has an ID and GPA.
2. Deleting the Oldest Record
Removes the head node (the oldest student record) from the doubly linked list.
3. Removing Duplicate Records
Removes duplicate student records, keeping only the first occurrence and deleting subsequent duplicates.
4. Reversing the Records
Reverses the doubly linked list to allow viewing student records in reverse order of their addition.
5. Rotating the Records
Rotates the linked list by a given number of positions, useful for batch-wise student record access.
6. Sorting Records by GPA
Creates a new doubly linked list sorted by GPA in descending order, useful for merit-based data retrieval.
